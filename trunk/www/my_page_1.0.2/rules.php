				<h1>War of Gods rules:</h1>
				<br \>
				<div>
				  If you want to play War of Gods, you are obliged to  stand
			      by our rules. The rules  are here to ensure that  the game
			      is fair  for everyone.  By playing  War of  Gods, you  are
			      implying agreement to follow  these rules even if  you may
			      not agree with what the rules say. 
			
			      Continuously ignoring and/or breaking these rules is taken
			      as indication that you no longer wish to continue  playing
			      this game and we shall act accordingly. See help  warning,
			      help banish.
			
			      This help file lists only the basic backbone of the rules.
			      We expect players to follow  the spirit of the rules,  not
			      just the letter of the law. If you think you have found  a
			      way around  the letter,  you can  be pretty  sure you  are
			      violating the spirit and will be treated no less harshly.
			
			      way around  the letter,  you can  be pretty  sure you  are
			      violating the spirit and will be treated no less harshly.
			
			      Still, we have details available of what exactly the rules
			      mean, so further information can be found in related  help
			      files listed below. Do not think, however, that  following
			      even the most precise  wording is any excuse  for ignoring
		       	  the spirit of the rules.
		
			      Remember, if you're not sure whether something is illegal,
			      assume that it is, unless a  creator tells you  otherwise. 
			      Feel free to ask !

				<div>
       			  1. YOU MAY HAVE ONLY ONE ACCOUNT.
       			</div>
       			<div> 
		          You may own  as many characters  as you want,  but they
		          all must belong to the same account. Yes, you may  have
		          only one account and different people may not share the
		
		          same account. This is the rule number one and violation
		          of this rule means deletion of all your characters.
				</div><br \>
				<div>
			       2. MULTIPLAYING IS NOT ALLOWED.
				</div>
				<div>
		          Multiplaying is  playing more  than one  character at a
		          time. Multiplaying  is ILLEGAL  at ALL  TIMES. You  may
		          have as  many characters  as you'd  like, however, they
		          may not be on  at the same time, not may  they interact
		          in such a way as follows:
		
		          You may not take  vengence with an alt. That is, if any
		          of your characters is killed  in a PK you may  not take
		          revenge by using any other of your characters.
		
		          You  may  not transfer  money, equipment  or any  items
		          between     characters    from   the   opposite   sides
		          (darkie/whittie). This also means selling an item  with
		
		          one character  and then  buying it  back with  another.
		          That is illegal.
		
		          You may not  switch between whittie/darkie  characters.
		          This means you rent your whittie character and at  next
		          minute you are  logged in with  darkie and vice  versa.
		          Time  between change  of white/darkie  character is  30
		          minutes.
		          
		          The same character  cannot be shared  by more than  one
		          player.
				</div><br \>
				<div>
 			      3. CHARACTER NAMES MUST FOLLOW THE FANTASY THEME.
       			</div>
       			<div> 
		          Here  at  the  War of  Gods  we  promote a  roleplaying
		          environment.  Because  of this  atmosphere,  we do  not
		          allow just any name you may want. The names must meet a
		          certain  criteria  and if  they  do not,  they  will be
				  denied. The criteria are following:
		
		          The name  must be  original as  far as  you know.  (You
		          can't use  the name  mentioned  in any book,   film and
		          also names known  from  history or  the names  used  in
		          this mud)
		
		          The name can't be a combination of two other names.
		
		          The  name can't  be  found  in  any   dictionary  or  a
		          common slang term.
		
		          The name must fit to the fantasy theme and to the  race
		          you will  choose.(Don't use  name John  or Charles  for
		          your dwarf)
		
		          If your name  is not appropriate,  then we reserve  the
		          right to  REMOVE it  and DELETE  your character without
		          notification !
				</div><br \>
				<div>
		       	  4. POWER LEVELING IS ILLEGAL.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          Power leveling is gaining  experience with the help  of
		          more than 15  levels higher players.  The reason is  to
		          prevent lower level people with high-level friends from
		          having huge advantages over true new players. 
		
		          Methods  of  aiding other  players  without creating  a
		          party are  illegal. Following  somebody else  around to
		          heal  or spell  them up  while they  fight is  illegal,
		          regardless of  the levels  involved. Wounding  a mob to
		          let somebody else finish it off is illegal.
		
		          Use common sense when trying to decide if something  is
		          acceptable or not; it's okay for a low-level  character
		          to  occasionally get  some spells  from a  higher-level
		          friend, but  not okay  for that  low-level character to
				  have access to a constant high-level spell up.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          5. QUESTS ARE TO REMAIN SECRET. 
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          If you have solved a quest you are not allowed  to tell
		          others how to solve it. Several people who have not yet
		          solved  a quest  may work  on it  together. Asking  for
		          quest info is against the rules.  However, if you think
		          you need an  item to solve  a quest you  may ask others
		          where that item may be located. 
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          6. HARASSMENT IN GLOBAL CHANNELS IS NOT ALLOWED.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          We  ask  you  to  try  to  keep  personal  attacks  and
		          arguments  out  of  global channels.  Please  act  in a
		          mature fashion  and do  not insult  other people unless
		          you have a good reason to do so.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          7. CURSING IN GLOBAL CHANNELS IS NOT ALLOWED.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          It is unrealistic to ask that nobody ever swear in  War
		          of Gods.  However, as  this is  an all-ages  mud, we do
		          want  to keep  global channels  clean of  any obscene,
		          foul, and/or adult content. Please keep that in mind.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          8. SPAMMING IS NOT ALLOWED.  
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          Spamming  is the  repeated display  of messages  to an
		          annoying  degree.  It  can be  in  the  form of  tells,
		          shouts, says, emotes or channels.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          9. KILL STEALING IS ILLEGAL.   
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          This means if  someone else is  killing a monster  or a
		          player you  can not  join in  without their permission.
		          This also means  you can not  loot the corpse  when the
		          monster or the player dies. However, this does not mean
		          you can't kill a wounded  monster when there is no  one
		          around, nor does  it mean you  can not loot  corpses of
		          either monsters or players that you may come across.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          10. USING SCRIPTS IS ILLEGAL.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          Scripting is illegal.  Scripting  is creating   a 'bot'
		          which is basically a scripted program which allows  you
		          to play while away from the keyboard. 
		
		          The only scripts which  are allowed are ones  which let
		          you traverse great distances with a few keystrokes.  If
		          you are not at the keyboard your character MUST  remain
		          idle if you do not disconnect.  
		
		          Simply if your scripts or triggers are playing the game
		          for you, they are illegal.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          11. USING TRIGGERS IS VERY RESTRICTED.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          Triggers  are  not  illegal  (this  does  not   include
		          autokill, autofollow  or similar  triggers, which   may
		          give you an advantage in PK).   
		
		          Triggers  are  allowed,  AS  LONG  AS  YOU  ARE  AT THE
		          KEYBOARD. Triggers which allow you to auto-loot corpses
		          when monsters die, or  heal others are allowed  AS LONG
		          AS YOU ARE AT THE KEYBOARD.
		
		          Note that "AT THE KEYBOARD" means "at your keyboard and
		          paying attention to the game". If you have a mud client
		          in a  window in  the background  and you're  not paying
		          attention  to  it, then  the  above restrictions  still
		          apply. 
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          12. BUG REPORTING IS STRONGLY ENCOURAGED.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          If you find a bug, or think you might have found a bug,
		          report it. The same goes for people breaking the rules.
		
		          Exploiting bugs, intentional   or not is  illegal. This
		          includes, but is not  limited to bugs which  allow easy
		          money, experience  or obtaining  of equipment.  It also
		          includes bugs which can harm another player in any way. 
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
		          13. COOPERATION WITH CREATORS IS ILLEGAL.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		        
		          The  game is  played by  players and  run by  creators.
		          Creators can not,  in any way,  change the flow  of the
		          game.   This  includes  any  information  about quests,
		          healing,  resetting rooms  and so  on.  So  don't ask.
		
		          The only time you may ask a creator for help is if  you
		          are  stuck  in  a  room  with  no  exits  and  no  room
		          description, or  when a  monster you  are fighting will
		          not die, or any other such bug prevents a normal day in
		          War of Gods.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		          
		          14. REIMBURSEMENT DUE TO BUGS.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          It is impossible to keep track of everyone's  equipment
		          and reimburse it when lost. Because of this, only  rare
		          and  hard-to-find  items can  be  reimbursed, and  even
		          then, only in special circumstances.
		
		          Try not to drop or leave valuable items on the  ground.
		          It the  game crashes,  they will  be gone.  War of Gods
		          offers the  possibility to  deposit your  equipment, so
		          use it.
		          
		          If you lose such items,  please report it to a  creator
		          as soon as possible and  send a log that show  that you
		          owned those items.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		          
		          15. MISCELLANEOUS. GENERAL TROUBLE MAKING.
       			</div>
       			<div> 		
		          Sometimes it is  necessary to make  unpopular decisions
		          and  players may  often have  grievances with  creators
		          and/or other players. This is a part of mud life and is
		          normal. If you  have a problem  then make your  opinion
		          known,  just do  it respectfully,  no-one is  going to
		          listen to 'you idiots sux for that changes!'.
		          If  this  'rule'  troubles you,  it  shouldn't.  If you
		          constantly  push your  luck and  stretch rules  to the
		          limit then you will be  warned and if it does  not stop
		          you will BE stopped.  For the vast majority  of players
		          this is just not an issue. Do not mistake this rule  as
		          a  sign  that we  do  not want  to  hear (constructive)
		          criticism, honest  feedback is  extremely valuable  and
		          has been always appreciated.  If you just want  to keep
		          pointing out how stupid you think creators are and  how
		          you can do so much better, then go prove it,  somewhere
		          else.
				</div><br \>
				<div>		
			      Remember, who you are and  what you are when you  turn off
			      the computer is of absolutely no consequence here. In  War
			      of  Gods  you  are determined  solely  by  your words  and
			      actions. So please... Think before you type.
