				<h1>History of Order of Holy Retribution</h1>
				<br />
				<div>
				In the times  of bloody wars  between evil creatures  and good races,  in
			 	times when life had no price,  when the world was struggling in  battles,
			 	the earth gave lives to four heroes.</div><br />
			 	<div>
			 	As children they didn't realized their unique mission on the world,  they
			 	were thrown into without parents. Two  old but really noble and wise  men
			 	raised them as their  own in the city  known as Moonsdale. They  told the
			 	youngsters that their parents were  killed by the evil ruler  of Kellwar,
			 	by Fingol himself, but the truth was, that they had no parents, they were
			 	created by earth, and their power arrived from the Holy Gods, who  wanted
			 	to return the balance between the  Light and Dark. When the younger  ones
			 	reached the  seventh year  of their  life, four  strangers arrived to the
			 	city on black horses, and every one of them took one of the boys with him
			 	to an unknown place to  awake their sleeping powers. The  old committee's
			 	heart was really heavy when they saw and heard the children cry, but they
			 	knew, this they should come.</div><br />
			 	<div>
			 	The  youngsters were  taken to  smaller keeps  to awake  their god-given
			 	powers and to  master in their  arts. The wisest  of them, Targo,  was an
			 	everyday guest in the library full  of grimoirs and books full of  magic.
			 	One day he found a wounded dove on the breast of his window, took him  in
			 	his palms, and with the power of his will he cured him. It was his  first
			 	spell and it  showed him the  way how to  be a cleric.  Barbara, the only
			 	girl  between  three  boys,  showed some  unbelievable  hate  to  all the
			 	creatures of evil. Her hate  gave her extreme power and  strength against
			 	everything what is evil, and  during trainings she also mastered  special
			 	fighting tactics. The third one,  Kilgor, a bit smaller than  others, was
			 	taken to the northern mountains.  He was the strongest and  the sturdiest
			 	amongst them. He was afraid of  nothing and loved the fights. His  master
			 	soon realized the small  boy's love to the  weapons. He tough him  how to
			 	fight with almost every weapon, but  the young boy found his pleasure  in
			 	larger, heavier weapons. The last one, known as Tyrko, was very brave and
			 	fearless. He  often wandered  deep into  the Shadowland  on his steed. Hi
			 	simply loved the mounted  fights. He was not  only strong, but Gods  gave
			 	him also feels for  justice, he never hurts  anyone who was innocent.  In
			 	addition,  he received  the skill  from Leoric  to heal  himself and  his
			 	friends.</div><br />
			 	<div>
			 	All four,  now already  adult adventurers  were trained  to complete  the
			 	destiny they were given by the  Gods. Nowadays they four met (not  really
			 	incidentally) after twelve years,  to follow their faith,  their destiny.
			 	They build up their large keep deeply in the Mithrildowns, and from there
			 	they are  riding out  on their  heavy steeds,  burning down  every doomed
			 	village, but what is important:  blessing wastelands in the name  of Holy
			 	Gods.</div><br />
			 	<div>
			 	From now, four sibs, brothers in destiny are traveling together, bringing
			 	light to every doomed dark  corner, dealing mighty slaps to  every cursed
			 	soul.</div>
