      You are south from gated of Tangwar. In west you can barely see 
      remains of building that has probably been stable. In east there are 
  O   two more buildings, badly damaged barracks. In north you can see the 
  |   open entrance to outside, there has probably been gates but now they 
O-X-O are long gone. Dark walls surround the fortress, part of it is teared 
|X|X| down and you can see large holes every here and there. For some reason 
O-O-O darkness feels much deeper inside the fortress. You feel sudden wave 
      of fear coming over to you when you look to south, the main building 
      seems to pulsate evilness and even the darkness is much deeper in 
      there. 
A long rope is stretched near the ground to the north.

You follow Khan...
      You stand outside of Tangwar. The fortress itself, surrounded by 
      burned and dark walls opens in south. You notice that the gates that 
 -O-  once resided in entrance have been forced open, it almost seems that 
  |   someone has teared them off and then tossed them aside. Above the door 
  X   you can see sign that hangs there loosely, there seems to be some 
  |   writing in it but it's hard to say from all soot. In both sides of the 
O-O-O gate there are remains of two wooden guard booths. For some reason the 
      fortress feels repulsive and when you think about going inside you 
      feel wave of fear coming over to you.

      You stand outside of Tangwar. The fortress itself, surrounded by 
      burned and dark walls opens in south. You notice that the gates that 
 -O-  once resided in entrance have been forced open, it almost seems that 
  |   someone has teared them off and then tossed them aside. Above the door 
  X   you can see sign that hangs there loosely, there seems to be some 
  |   writing in it but it's hard to say from all soot. In both sides of the 
O-O-O gate there are remains of two wooden guard booths. For some reason the 
      fortress feels repulsive and when you think about going inside you 
      feel wave of fear coming over to you.
