      You are standing before a huge portcullised city wall. A few men are 
  #   walking on it and look like guards. But you have noticed also 
  <font color="#00FFFF">X</font><font color=white>   something else. It is strange, but there is something as a magical 
  |   aura over the place you are stand- ing on. It's impossible to get in 
  O   right through this closed, heavy portcullis. After all, there is a 
      huge helicon hanging on the chain.

      This is a dark passage reminding a lair of a cave bear. But there is

  <font color="#00FFFF">X</font><font color=white>   junction of two such the very places. The valley full of snakes and 
      according to the smell coming from the north, some huge stinky town. 
      Many adventurers accustom themselves to spend the night here and 
      collect all their power before entering the hidden and unknown city. 
      Some bones are lying on the floor.
