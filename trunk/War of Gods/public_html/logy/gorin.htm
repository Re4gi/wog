You are standing at an edge of the legendary forest Andvar. It should

<font color=white>  |   A huge menhir stands in front of the wood and on its surface is <font color=white>
<font color=white>O-O-O engraved some symbol. You've noticed a nasty wooden board which stands <font color=white>
<font color=white>      in front of the forest. <font color=white>
