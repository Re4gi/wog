You find yourself in the entering hall of the second noble house. The white
marble floor is highly polished, reflecting your gaze as you look down onto it.
A silver chandelier with ten candles lights the hall. Two statues of tigers
are leaning each other with their paws over the entrance in the southern wall.
Mercenaries are usually hired to guard this entrance.

ceiling. Ancient paintings of lord's ancestors in silver frames are not any
exception. There are heavy wooden chairs tucked under the round ebony table.
A dust floats in the north direction.
