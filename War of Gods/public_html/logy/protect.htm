To the east a steep rocky wall raises high forming slope, which
borders the valley from that side. A huge grey rock blocks the way
to the west. There are even the bones of humanoids on the ground.
Maybe remains of adventurers just like you, only not so lucky.
Magical darkness is covering the room.

The rocky ground is full of long ago died away boughs, remains of
rusty iron and bones of various size. Many old rusty now useless
weapons and armours witness to many great battles fought here which
obviously ended by defeat of one side.

A wide dale opens before you as the mountains steps out here. This
valley is known as Snake valley and there are many reasons for that.
The valley is bordered by steep rocky walls both from the west and
east side and extends far to the south. A walkable path leads north
and continues east far away from the Border hills.
Magical darkness is covering the room.
