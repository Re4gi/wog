Clicky, clacky....
  O   You are standing right within opening in the city wall. There are two 
  |   rooms built right in the city wall on the east and west. You have 
O-<font color="#00FFFF">X</font><font color=white>-O noticed that they both are the stables for the mounts. A big mechanism 
  #   using for opening of portcullis is also here, usually tended by local 
      guards. The whole city is extending to the north. 
A long rope is stretched near the ground to the west.

O-O-O You are standing before a huge portcullised city wall. A few men are 
  #   walking on it and look like guards. But you have noticed also 
  <font color="#00FFFF">X</font><font color=white>   something else. It is strange, but there is something as a magical 
  |   aura over the place you are stand- ing on. It's impossible to get in

      huge helicon hanging on the chain.
