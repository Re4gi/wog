You are standing before a huge portcullised city wall. A few men are 
walking on it and look like guards. But you have noticed also something 
else. It is strange, but there is something as a magical aura over the 
place you are stand- ing on. It's impossible to get in right through this 
closed, heavy portcullis. After all, there is a huge helicon hanging on the 
chain. 
<font color=lime>There is a portcullis(closed)</font><font color=white>
<font color=lime>There is one obvious exit: south.</font><font color=white>

The portcullis is open now.
You are standing right within opening in the city wall. There are two rooms 
built right in the city wall on the east and west. You have noticed that 
they both are the stables for the mounts. A big mechanism using for opening 
of portcullis is also here, usually tended by local guards. The whole city 
is extending to the north.

You are standing on the Y-crossing. There is a high wall standing to the 
north. It is long and leading from the south to the north through the whole 
city, separating it to western and eastern part. It was built on account of 
confla- grations. It is simply fire-breaking wall. Now it's time to decide: 
northwest or northeast... 
There is a bulletin board here.

You are standing on the Y-crossing. There is a high wall standing to the 
north. It is long and leading from the south to the north through the whole 
city, separating it to western and eastern part. It was built on account of 
confla- grations. It is simply fire-breaking wall. Now it's time to decide: 
northwest or northeast... 
There is a bulletin board here.

You are standing right within opening in the city wall. There are two rooms 
built right in the city wall on the east and west. You have noticed that 
they both are the stables for the mounts. A big mechanism using for opening 
of portcullis is also here, usually tended by local guards. The whole city 
is extending to the north.
