You are standing on the Y-crossing. There is a high wall standing to the 
north. It is long and leading from the south to the north through the whole

confla- grations. It is simply fire-breaking wall. Now it's time to decide: 
northwest or northeast...

You are walking on the Short street leading along the southern city wall. 
The door of some inconspicuous house is situated to the north. To the west 
is some burnt building. Only a small black iron plate reveals that it was 
an old armour shop. A dust of the street slightly covers your shoes even if 
the road is paved with the rough cobble-stones.

A few years ago there was an armour shop here. Now the whole room is black
and burnt out. Probably it is a remain after a big fire in this district.
